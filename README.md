## Portfolio Projects

### MySQL Projects
#### 1.Financial Loan Data Analysis SQL Queries
- **Goal**: Analyze financial loan data using SQL for querying and Tableau for visualization to uncover trends and insights.
- **Description**: his project involves financial loan data analysis. After querying the dataset using SQL for insights on loan status,
- applicant demographics, and loan types, the dataset was transferred to Tableau for creating visualizations that highlight trends and key metrics.
**Skills**: SQL queries (SELECT, JOIN, GROUP BY, etc.), Data cleaning, Data transformation.
- **Technology**: MySQL.

#### 2. Layoffs Data Cleaning and Transformation Project
- **Goal**: To clean and transform raw layoffs data using SQL, ensuring data quality for further analysis by addressing missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies.
- **Description**:s project processes a dataset of company layoffs by performing essential cleaning and transformations. Key steps include:
Handling Missing Values: Cleaned fields like total_laid_off, industry, and percentage_laid_off.
Removing Duplicates: Used ROW_NUMBER() and PARTITION BY to remove duplicate rows.
Data Standardization: Trimmed and corrected inconsistent fields such as industry and country.
Date Conversion: Converted date from string format to a valid DATE format using STR_TO_DATE().
- **Skills**: SQL queries (SELECT, JOIN, GROUP BY, etc.), Data cleaning, Data transformation.
- **Technology**: MySQL.

### Python Projects

#### 1. Sentiment Analysis on Online Discussions (Research Project)
- **Goal**: Develop and propose a model for performing sentiment analysis on online discussions.
- **Description**: This was my final year research project, where we proposed a model for sentiment analysis on user-generated content from social media platforms. The project involved analyzing comments and posts to categorize opinions into positive, neutral, or negative sentiments. The model was developed and tested using a large dataset of online discussions, and the results showed promising accuracy.
- **Skills**: Model development, Natural Language Processing (NLP), sentiment classification, data preprocessing.
- **Technology**: Python, NLTK, Pandas, Scikit-learn.

#### 3.Loan Eligibility Prediction (Python Project)
- **Goal**: Predict loan eligibility based on applicant data and financial information.
- **Description**: This project aims to develop a predictive model to assess whether an applicant is eligible for a loan. The analysis involves visualizing key features such as credit scores and loan status, followed by the implementation of a Random Forest classifier    to classify loan eligibility. The model was evaluated using precision, recall, and F1-score metrics, with cross-validation to ensure robustness. The results indicate a strong performance in predicting loan eligibility.
  Skills: Data visualization, feature engineering, model training and evaluation, cross-validation.
- **Technology**: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn.
