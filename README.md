About

Hi, I'm Annim! I have a strong background in Computer Science (BSc) and Data Science, with a keen interest in using data to solve complex problems and drive insights. I’m currently seeking opportunities in the data analytics and machine learning space, and I’m on track to further my education in these fields as I aim to pursue a Ph.D.

Throughout my academic and professional journey, I’ve built a solid foundation in computer science and full-stack development, and I’ve developed practical skills in data analysis, machine learning, and statistical analysis. My projects have involved using tools like Python, Excel, MySQL, Tableau, and Power BI, where I’ve explored areas like customer segmentation, sentiment analysis, and educational impact assessment. I am passionate about uncovering trends, patterns, and meaningful insights from complex datasets.

I’ve also gained practical experience working in roles such as IT Officer and ICT Coordinator, where I sharpened my problem-solving skills in real-world environments. Whether working on a project individually or collaborating in a team, I am driven by the desire to leverage data to make informed decisions.

When I’m not working on data-related projects, I enjoy exploring the latest tools and techniques in data science and machine learning, always looking for ways to expand my expertise. I’m excited to apply my technical skills and passion for data analysis to contribute to impactful solutions in any organization.
